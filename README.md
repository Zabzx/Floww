# Floww
My first full ReactJS project from scratch, I used a custom react hook for image uploading along with react hooks, and react router
At the beginning you fill out a form that asks for some basic information, there is validation for email, password length and making sure the confirmation password matches the original

After completing the form, you will be left with a Feed of hard coded posts, from users with profile pictures, names, a status and maybe even an image. There is a sticky navigation bar at the left for your basic social media features (these don't do anything) (yet).
You can also create a post.

In the profile section that you can find in the main navigation bar, you can see some of the info you entered such as your username and email address. You can also upload your very own profile picture that will show up with your posts! Your liked posts will also show up here.
